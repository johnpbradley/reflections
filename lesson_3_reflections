When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
A copy of a repository on a remote machine can serve as a backup in case
something happens to the local copy. A remote repository can also be accessed
by others if your machine is off.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not want the most recent changes in the branch you're currently working
in. You might also want to keep the project you've downloaded in a working,
stable state.
