What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
An empty .git directory is created. If you didn't git init it wouldn't be there

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the in-between area where changes are setup to go into the
repository. This allows greater control over what each commit commits.
